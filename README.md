# Optimal Representative Training Subset Selection (Capstone Project Fall 2020)

### Center for Data Science, New York University

Abstract: Training classifiers for text-as-data applications requires high quality annotated or labeled data. Hand-labeling is costly and prone to errors. Scaling up the amount of data only exacerbates the problem. In this paper, I propose novel unsupervised methods for selecting a representative subset for hand-labeling, and training the first instance of the classification model optimally.
